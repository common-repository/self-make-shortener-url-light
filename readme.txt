Make a short url in your domain.Very easy. No setting at all. Batch registration with CSV.Hide the affiliate link.

== Description ==

This plugin creates abbreviated URLs using the domains owned by you.
The shortened URL created will last forever until you lose that domain.
The biggest feature of this plug-in is that it's easy to set up.
Because there is nothing to do anything other than uploading the CSV file.
There is no problem setting them one by one, it is serious if there are as many as five as well as five?
You can use the Excel file of yourself to register the necessary settings at once.
Set nofollow, noindex, 301, 302 etc at once.
This is terribly amazing.

Suppose you are following url when introducing your url.
http://xxxxxx.com/fdsgwer
I can not remember it for a while.
But is this form okay?
http://xxxxxx.com/fd
This will be remembered.
It may be random, or you can make it according to the rule you can remember and you can do it as you like.

In addition, this plugin has a simple click analysis function.
This plug-in that does not need to use external service and works in your domain logs and displays that fact at the moment of clicking.
